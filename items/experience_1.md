<h2>Summer Intership<h2/>

<p>What was it that you did?

- I had a summer intership at the peoples church. This wasn't my first internship here I have had two others before this place. Each time was a different experince. I learned different things, and made memories. I help out with summer camps, the prep and take down. I coached two soccer teams and helped out with sunday school. 

When did you do it?
- the last time that I had an internship there was july to august of 2023, this past summer. 

What was good about it?
- I worked with so many wonderful people. Some of which are still my friends, the enironment was easy to learn in. 

What was your favourite memory of it?
- working 12 hour shifts on tuesdays after work we all coached soccer teams and got to hangout. Or maybe when we were testing the fire experiemnts for the summer camp, or maybe....needless to say there are too many to choose from. 

What didn't you enjoy about it?
- There are always challenges when working jobs. Some days were boring or i was tired, we all were and didnt really feel like being at work, which made some jobs take longer then others.

Give your experience a letter "grade"
- I would give it a B.<p/>
